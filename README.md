# Catalog importer

## What is it?

This is a tiny piece of code to play around and combine Scala, Spark, Guice and Cats together.

The pretext application is one where we want to separate a potentially big catalog of items into a valid one (say, them items with an image) and invalid ones.

## How to run?

`sbt` is a prerequisite.

`sbt compile run` to run the app.

`sbt test` to run the unit tests.
